-     Description     -
-----------------------
This is a voxel renderer that I created for my Ace of Spades clone to render voxels in OpenGL.

It uses pure OpenGL functions, so no language specific library. Unfortunately for you, unless you use Java you can't use this. Sorry :/

(NOTE: It uses LWJGL as the OpenGL wrapper for Java, so you will need LWJGL)

I might port it to C++ someday, but until then use Java. It's freaking awesome.

-    Installation     -
-----------------------
First make sure you have LWJGL installed with your IDE (unless you aren't using an IDE, in which case.. well you should already know what to do).

When you have LWJGL, using this library should be easy. But of course, I made it for private use. So you never know. If you fail at installation, don't complain to me. I didn't make it for you.
